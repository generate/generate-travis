## CLI

**Installing the CLI**

To run the `{%= alias %}` generator from the command line, you'll need to install [generate][] globally first. You can that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install generate --global 
```

This adds the `gen` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory. Visit the [generate][] project and documentation to learn more.

**Run the `{%= alias %}` generator from the command line**

Once both [generate][] and `{%= name %}` are installed globally, you can run the generator with the following command: 

```sh
$ gen {%= alias %}
```
